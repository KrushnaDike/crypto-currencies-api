# Getting Started with Create API App

## by 6PP

In this project we are going to create a app which fetch api and show that currency data

## used api:- https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=inr

By using reactJs & axios

# Axios:-
  Axios is similar to fetch but fetch required lengthy code
  Instead Axios is easy to understand and code
  # const {data} = axios.get("https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=inr");

# ReactJs:-
      ReactJs is a JavaScript Library to design pages well in easy way.
      Component Based
      Declarative approach
      instead in VanilaJs --> Imperative approach
